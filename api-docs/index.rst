What is EVA?
------------

`EVA <https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva>`_ is a visual data management system (think MySQL for videos). It supports a declarative language similar to SQL and a wide range of commonly used  computer vision models.

What does EVA do?
-----------------

* EVA **enables querying of visual data** in user facing applications by providing a simple SQL-like interface for a wide range of commonly used computer vision models.

* EVA **improves throughput** by introducing sampling, filtering, and caching techniques.

* EVA **improves accuracy** by introducing state-of-the-art model specialization and selection algorithms.
