What is EVA?
------------

EVA is a **database system tailored for video analytics** -- think PostgreSQL for videos. It supports a SQL-like language for querying videos like:

 * examining the "emotion palette" of different actors
 * finding gameplays that lead to a touchdown in a football game

EVA comes with a wide range of commonly used computer vision models. It written in Python, and it is licensed under the Apache license. The source code is available at https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva.

If you are wondering why you might need a video database system, start with page on `Video Database Systems <source/overview/video.html>`_. It describes how EVA lets users easily make use of deep learning models and how they can reduce money spent on inference on large image or video datasets.

The `Getting Started <source/overview/installation.html>`_ page shows how you can use EVA for different computer vision tasks: image classification, object detection, action recognition, and how you can easily extend EVA to support your custom deep learning model in the form of user-defined functions.

The `User Guides <source/tutorials/index.html>`_ section contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to use various features of EVA. Each notebook includes a link to Google Colab, where you can run the code by yourself.

Key Features
------------

1. With EVA, you can **easily combine SQL and deep learning models to build next-generation database applications**. EVA treats deep learning models as  functions similar to traditional SQL functions like SUM().

2. EVA is **extensible by design**. You can write an **user-defined function** (UDF) that wraps arounds your custom deep learning model. In fact, all the built-in models that are included in EVA are written as user-defined functions.

3. EVA comes with a collection of **built-in sampling, caching, and filtering optimizations** inspired by relational database systems. These optimizations help **speed up queries on large datasets and save money spent on model inference**.
