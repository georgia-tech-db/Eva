Hacker News
===========

Dependency
----------

* Requests-HTML

Parameters
----------

Optional:

* ``maxitem`` stablishes a limit on how many rows to get for the users and the items table. If this argument is ommited, the maximum number of rows will be set to the number obtained from the official API `max_items <https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json?print=pretty>`. It is important to highlight that the number provided by the API is big and queries will take a long time to execute.
