Leverage Text Processing AI Models with EvaDB
---------------------------------------------

By integrating databases and OpenAI using EvaDB, developers can easily extract insights from text data with just a few EvaQL queries. These powerful natural language processing (NLP) models are capable of answering complex questions with ``context`` (e.g., a column in a table).

There is no need to train these large language models. This allows developers to easily incorporate powerful NLP capabilities into their applications while saving time and resources compared to traditional AI development pipelines. To summarize, EvaDB makes it super easy for you to harness the power of OpenAI models in your AI-powered applications.
