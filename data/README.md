### Table of Content
* aic480
* aic540
* aic1080
* UA-DETRAC
* Dataset usage by UIUC team for NVIDIA AI City Challenge

## Make a table that shows how many images for each set, the resolution, how many categories for each set


### aic480, aic1080, aic540
An explanation about what kind of images (pictures taken from cctv footage, what is the geographical location, what time of day)
Same applies for aic540, aic1080, UA-DETRAC
for aic540, mention it is only downsampled from aic1080

Car, SUV, SmallTruck, MediumTruck, LargeTruck, Pedestrian, Bus, Van, GroupOfPeople, Bicycle, 
Motorcycle, TrafficSignal-Green, TrafficSignal-Yellow, TrafficSignal-Red, and Crossing

### UA-DETRAC


### How did these people use the datasets
Mention they only used aic480, aic1080. They did use some augementation techniques-> hard negative example mining (outline which ones)
They did not use UA-DETRAC because it only had 4 types of labels.

Possible challenges that are different from other datasets is that lighting conditions differ heavily,
angle of view is a bit peculiar.
